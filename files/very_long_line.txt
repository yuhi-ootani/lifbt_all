1. Empty File (empty.txt)
Content: (No content; the file is empty)
Purpose: Tests how your function handles reading from an empty file.

2. Single Line without Newline at EOF (single_line_no_newline.txt)
Content:
vbnet
コードをコピーする
This is a single line without a newline character at the end.
Purpose: Checks if your function correctly reads the last line even when it doesn't end with a newline character.

3. Single Line with Newline at EOF (single_line_with_newline.txt)
Content:

vbnet
コードをコピーする
This is a single line with a newline character at the end.
(Ensure there's a newline character at the end of the line)

Purpose: Verifies that your function can read a single line that ends with a newline character.

4. Multiple Lines (multiple_lines.txt)
Content:
arduino
コードをコピーする
First line.
Second line.
Third line.
Purpose: Tests reading multiple lines sequentially and handling newline characters correctly.

5. Lines Longer than BUFFER_SIZE (long_lines.txt)
Content:

arduino
コードをコピーする
[A line longer than your BUFFER_SIZE]
Example (assuming BUFFER_SIZE is 32):

arduino
コードをコピーする
This line is intentionally made longer than the defined BUFFER_SIZE to test if the get_next_line function can handle lines that exceed the buffer limit without any issues.
Purpose: Ensures that your function can handle lines that are longer than the buffer size and read them completely.

6. Multiple Consecutive Newlines (consecutive_newlines.txt)
Content:
arduino
コードをコピーする
First line.

Second line after two newlines.

Purpose: Tests how your function handles empty lines and multiple consecutive newline characters.

7. File with Only Newlines (only_newlines.txt)
Content:

コードをコピーする




(Contains several newline characters without any other text)

Purpose: Checks if your function can handle files that consist solely of newline characters.

8. No Newline at End of File (no_newline_eof.txt)
Content:
scss
コードをコピーする
Line without a newline at EOF
Another line without newline
Purpose: Tests reading multiple lines when the file does not end with a newline character.

9. Mixed Line Endings (mixed_line_endings.txt)
Content:

csharp
コードをコピーする
Line with LF\n
Line with CRLF\r\n
Line with CR\r
(Use actual line endings in the file)

Purpose: Checks how your function handles different types of line endings (Unix LF \n, Windows CRLF \r\n, old Mac CR \r).

10. Large File (large_file.txt)
Content: (A file containing a large amount of text, possibly several megabytes in size)

Example: Repeat a line or a paragraph multiple times to create a large file.

Purpose: Tests the performance and memory management of your function when dealing with large files.

11. File with Null Characters (null_chars.txt)
Content:
csharp
コードをコピーする
Line before null char.\0Line after null char.
Purpose: Verifies that your function can handle strings with null characters embedded within them.

12. Binary File (binary_file.bin)
Content: (A file containing binary data, not text)
Purpose: Ensures that your function behaves correctly when reading non-text files.

13. Unicode Characters (unicode_chars.txt)
Content:
arduino
コードをコピーする
This line contains Unicode characters: 測試, テスト, тест.
Purpose: Tests if your function can handle files with Unicode characters.

14. Very Long Single Line (very_long_line.txt)
Content: (A single line that is extremely long, possibly hundreds of thousands of characters)

Example: Repeat a character or word to create a very long line.

Purpose: Checks the robustness of your function when processing extremely long lines.

15. Special Characters (special_chars.txt)
Content:
csharp
コードをコピーする
Line with special characters: !@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;:',.<>/?`~"
Purpose: Ensures that special characters do not interfere with the reading process.
